Roadmap

  This page contains the roadmap of future versions.

Version 1.0

  Version 1.0 will be a full version and will concentrate on the following features.
  I anticipate completing this for October 2010.
  
    * Move to a method level annotation approach instead of whole class level
    
    * Aspect for marking classes as prototype so a warning is generated to ensure
    the class is replaced for production.
    
Version 1.1

  No features currently planned
